Lab 4 notes

Constructor is a unique method which has the same name as the class name and does not have a return type. The constructor is used to initialize the variables (object's attribute) and it will not return any values. If we don't provide a constructor, java will provide a default constructor with no parameters. A constructor with no parameter is used to assign a default value.

Eg: public Student()
	name = noname;

New keyword
The new keyword is used to create a new object (Eg: new Scanner(System.in)

overwrite = polymorphism

Setter & Getter
The setter and getters are used to increase the security (not every attributes are in the same method)
The setter (mutator) is used to set / modify the value of the object's attribute
The getter (accessor) is used to retrieve the value of the objects's attribute


Access modifier
public = the attributes can be accessed outside the class
private = the attributes can be accessed only within the class

Example:
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in)
Scanner = class name
keyboard = object
Scanner() = constructor

this keyword (this.) is used to specify the value to be assigned to the variable
Eg: this.carModel = car_Model;

toString method is used to return an object's string (print out the string of the objects)
Whenever we print out the values in the dummy file using system.out.print(); , it is implicitly calling the toString() method.

ArrayList<Car> al = new ArrayList<Car>() means it will only accept the values of the object Car into the ArrayList.
